###_Complete Guide to Monolithic vs. Microservices Architecture_###

**Monolithic arquitecture**
Monolithic arquitecture is normally the one that people and programmers use to do work because it is the most known, but lacks of modulatiry, if developers want to update the code they will have to modify it totally.

**Strengths of the Monolithic Architecture**
As mentioned before, this arquitecture is mostly used by developers because it is easier to implement and thats the main reason why users feel so comfortable wit it. It is also ease to test with it, everything is on the same languaje and that is really helpful.

**Weaknesses of the Monolithic Architecture**
One of the biggest weaknesses, and I think the most significant is to make changes now, since if you make changes in a part of the code, it is most likely that more code will have to be changed, since it is not modular and this It makes you waste more of the time needed to make an update. Another of the weakest points is that the issue of adding new technologies in an application that is with this architecture is complicated, since, if you change something, you have to change everything because, later, the entire application will be affected. 

**Weaknesses of the Microservice Architecture**
This is a modular architecture, this means that it is called by modules, normally, when you work with this architecture, you work with containers, where only these containers are connected, but each of them works in a unitary way, and even , the language in which you work does not necessarily have to be the same, they can be in different programming languages. This architecture consists of having different independent services but it is characterized by having small pieces of code which work together to reach an objective, which is to make the application work.


**Strengths of the Microservice Architecture**
One of the advantages is that, when you work in this way, it is easier to make changes since you only do it to a part of the code and the other part does not need to be changed since it will not be affected and in this way you can have a small group working on a single part of the code for greater agility. Another advantage is that you can work in the language that best suits you or that is easier for you, since this architecture allows you to be working with different languages at the same time.

**Weaknesses of the Microservice Architecture**
The most significant weakness is that the work becomes more complex, since a much larger application is made and therefore it becomes more complex. This tool is recommended to be used by large companies, with a large work team so that a certain part of the people focus on one part of the code and the other part on another. Also, being modular, it slows down development and is time consuming.
